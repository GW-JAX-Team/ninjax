# ninjax
`ninjax`: Nitro-speed inference with jax

`ninjax` will be designed to integrate with the following packages for a coherent setup of simulations of GW signals and inferring their properties.

- `flowMC`: JAX-based Bayesian inference accelerated by JAX and normalizing flows ([repo](https://github.com/kazewong/flowMC))
- `jim`: JAX-based Bayesian inference of gravitational waves ([repo](https://github.com/kazewong/jim))
- `ripple`: JAX-based waveforms for GW inference
